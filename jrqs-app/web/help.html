                        is a free open-source web application that allows to make search for the 
                        requirements parsed from Excel spreadsheets.

                            You should always keep in mind that search results might be outdated since 
                            jRQS search for the requirements parsed from Excel spreadsheets. The 
                            search results actuality depends on when jRQS's database was last updated 
                            by the jRQS instance administrator.

                    <h3 class="text-uppercase">How to search</h3>
                    <p>
                        Generally, it is possible to search for the requirements by exact FR ID, 
                        FR TMS task coincidence and by the keyword or a bunch of keywords separated 
                        by comma. In addition, it is possible to search by exact rowid in the database 
                        and filter out the results by FR sources separated by comma.
                    </p>

                            All the search is case-insensitive.

                                    In addition, search by range may be combined with standard

                                    Please note that range size is limited to 100, so the search 
                                    request like FR100-201 will be treated as invalid. Moreover, 
                                    overall search parameters are limited to the 100, so search 
                                    requests containing more than maximum allowed parameters will 
                                    be treated as invalid as well.

                                    For example, search by COBRA-1234 will find the COBRA-12345 as well.

                        If you got big search results, you may click on the source link to repeat the 
                        search using the only one particular source to make your search results 
                        more clear. Furthermore, you may specify more than one source to filter out 
                        the search results by  separating them with comma, but this should be done 
                        manually since UI does not provide such possibility. The same works for the
                        search by rowid.
